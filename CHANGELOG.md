## `2.5.1` (2023-07-18)

> 📦 [Available on Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/tufte/versions/2.5.1)

Identical to `2.5.0`, but synchronizes Encore dependency with my recent library releases (Timbre, Tufte, Sente, Carmine, etc.) to prevent confusion caused by dependency conflicts.

This is a safe update for users of `2.5.0`.

* [#27] Hotfix: fix broken Cljs build (@atroche)

## v2.0.0 - 2018 Apr 22

```clojure
[com.taoensso/tufte "2.0.0"]
```

> This is a major, **breaking** feature release. Please report any issues, thank you!

Tufte v2 introduces API flexibility improvements to expand on Tufte's strengths as an **ongoing application performance monitoring tool**.

Main objectives of the v2 API:

  - **Defer more profiling costs** off-thread, and on demand.
  - **Lossless merging** of profiling stats from different runs/threads/over-time.
  - Inclusion of **percentiles** in profiling stats.

These objectives are related: percentiles are expensive to calculate, so infeasible to do on the same thread as profiling capture. Also, stats like percentiles are inherently inaccurate to merge.

By deferring the conversion of captured times to stats, the Tufte v2 API makes it easy to support both lossless merging (by merging times, not stats) - and the inclusion of more expensive stats like percentiles (since the cost of stats computation can be incurred on demand, and off the capturing thread).

The net result: the v2 API is more flexible since it **decouples time capture and stats computation**.

The decoupling is particularly handy for the **ongoing performance monitoring** of production applications: the application thread/s can inexpensively capture timing info for deferred/async digestion by a background analytics/monitoring task.

**tl;dr** The v2 API returns `PStats` objects that can be **~losslessly merged**, or **derefed to actually compute statistics**.


### Detailed changes

* **BREAKING (1)**: `profiled` return value has changed: `[<result> <?stats-map>]` -> `[<result> <?pstats-obj>]`.

* **BREAKING (2)**: `profile` handler keys have changed: `:stats`, `:stats-str_` -> `:pstats`, `:pstats-str_`.

* **BREAKING (3)**: Utils were renamed: `merge-stats` -> `merge-pstats`, `format-stats` -> `format-pstats`.

* **BREAKING (4)**: Stats maps keys have changed: `#{:count :min :max :mean :mad :time}` -> `#{:n :min :max :mean :mad :sum :p50 :p90 :p95 :p99}`.

* **New**: Various readability tweaks+improvements to the output of `format-pstats`.

* **New**: `profiled` and `profile` calls now accept an `:nmax` option to control size of captured time buffers (used to prevent OOMs).

* **New**: Stats will now automatically include `:tufte/compaction` info when buffer sizes were exceeded.

* **New**: added several new fully-documented low-level primitives for advanced users: `new-pdata`, `with-profiling`, `capture-time!`.

* **Impl**: Significant performance improvements to both dynamic and thread-local profiling.


### Migration guide

- If you use only `profile` with an out-the-box (println or timbre) handler, there are **no breaking changes for you**.

- If you use `profile` with any custom handlers, you'll need to update your handler fns:

  - Stats map keys (as returned by @pstats) have changed (see **BREAKING (1)** above).
  - Map keys given to handler fns have changed (see **BREAKING (2)** above).

- If you use `profiled`, see **BREAKING (1, 3, 4)** above.
